</p>

* **Towards Real-time Applications**: PIDNet could be directly used for the real-time applications, such as autonomous vehicle and medical imaging.
* **A Novel Three-branch Network**: Addtional boundary branch is introduced to two-branch network to mimic the PID controller architecture and remedy the overshoot issue of previous models.
* **More Accurate and Faster**: PIDNet-S presents 78.6% mIOU with speed of 93.2 FPS on Cityscapes test set and 80.1% mIOU with speed of 153.7 FPS on CamVid test set. Also, PIDNet-L becomes the most accurate one (80.6% mIOU) among all the real-time networks for Cityscapes.

For operation, "OP, N, C" means operation OP with stride of N and the No. output channel is C; Output: output size given input size of 1024; mxRB: m residual basic blocks; 2xRBB: 2 residual bottleneck blocks; OP<sub>1</sub>\OP<sub>2</sub>: OP<sub>1</sub> is used for PIDNet-L while OP<sub>1</sub> is applied in PIDNet-M and PIDNet-S. (m,n,C) are scheduled to be (2,3,32), (2,3,64) and (3,4,64) for PIDNet-S, PIDNet-M and PIDNet-L, respectively.

## Prerequisites
This implementation is based on [HRNet-Semantic-Segmentation](https://github.com/HRNet/HRNet-Semantic-Segmentation). Please refer to their repository for installation and dataset preparation. The inference speed is tested on single RTX 3090 using the method introduced by [SwiftNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08469.pdf). No third-party acceleration lib is used, so you can try [TensorRT](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT) or other approaches for faster speed.

## Usage

### 0. Prepare the dataset

* Download the [Cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/) and [CamVid](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/) datasets and unzip them in `data/cityscapes` and `data/camvid` dirs.
* Check if the paths contained in lists of `data/list` are correct for dataset images.

#### :smiley_cat: Instruction for preparation of CamVid data (remains discussion) :smiley_cat:

* Download the images and annotations from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlolepelaars/camvid), where the resolution of images is 960x720 (original);
* Unzip the data and put all the images and all the colored labels into `data/camvid/images/` and `data/camvid/labels`, respectively;
* Following the split of train, val and test sets used in [SegNet-Tutorial](https://github.com/alexgkendall/SegNet-Tutorial), we have generated the dataset lists in `data/list/camvid/`;
* Finished!!! (We have open an issue for everyone who's interested in CamVid to discuss where to download the data and if the split in [SegNet-Tutorial](https://github.com/alexgkendall/SegNet-Tutorial) is correct. BTW, do not directly use the split in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlolepelaars/camvid), which is wrong and will lead to unnormal high accuracy. We have revised the CamVid content in the paper and you will see the correct results after its announcement.)
### 1. Training

* Download the ImageNet pretrained models and put them into `pretrained_models/imagenet/` dir.
* For example, train the PIDNet-S on Cityscapes with batch size of 12 on 2 GPUs:
````bash
python tools/train.py --cfg configs/cityscapes/pidnet_small_cityscapes.yaml GPUS (0,1) TRAIN.BATCH_SIZE_PER_GPU 6
````
* Or train the PIDNet-L on Cityscapes using train and val sets simultaneously with batch size of 12 on 4 GPUs:
````bash
python tools/train.py --cfg configs/cityscapes/pidnet_large_cityscapes_trainval.yaml GPUS (0,1,2,3) TRAIN.BATCH_SIZE_PER_GPU 3
````

### 2. Evaluation

* Download the finetuned models for Cityscapes and CamVid and put them into `pretrained_models/cityscapes/` and `pretrained_models/camvid/` dirs, respectively.
* For example, evaluate the PIDNet-S on Cityscapes val set:
````bash
python tools/eval.py --cfg configs/cityscapes/pidnet_small_cityscapes.yaml \
                          TEST.MODEL_FILE pretrained_models/cityscapes/PIDNet_S_Cityscapes_val.pt
````
* Or, evaluate the PIDNet-M on CamVid test set:
````bash
python tools/eval.py --cfg configs/camvid/pidnet_medium_camvid.yaml \
                          TEST.MODEL_FILE pretrained_models/camvid/PIDNet_M_Camvid_Test.pt \
                          DATASET.TEST_SET list/camvid/test.lst
````
* Generate the testing results of PIDNet-L on Cityscapes test set:
````bash
python tools/eval.py --cfg configs/cityscapes/pidnet_large_cityscapes_trainval.yaml \
                          TEST.MODEL_FILE pretrained_models/cityscapes/PIDNet_L_Cityscapes_test.pt \
                          DATASET.TEST_SET list/cityscapes/test.lst
````

### 3. Speed Measurement

* Measure the inference speed of PIDNet-S for Cityscapes:
````bash
python models/speed/pidnet_speed.py --a 'pidnet-s' --c 19 --r 1024 2048
````
* Measure the inference speed of PIDNet-M for CamVid:
````bash
python models/speed/pidnet_speed.py --a 'pidnet-m' --c 11 --r 720 960
````

### 4. Custom Inputs

* Put all your images in `samples/` and then run the command below using Cityscapes pretrained PIDNet-L for image format of .png:
````bash
python tools/custom.py --a 'pidnet-l' --p 'pretrained_models/cityscapes/PIDNet_L_Cityscapes_test.pt' --t '.png'
````
